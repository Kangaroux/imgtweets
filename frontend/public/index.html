                    the new pricing tiers for their API. Scraping a user's
                    timeline now requires their "basic" plan which costs $100
                    per month. ðŸ˜¬
                </p>
                <p>
                    imgtweets was always intended to be free to use, but I can't
                    spend $1200 per year just to keep it running. Unfortunately,
                    this means imgtweets will be shutdown for the foreseeable
                    future.
                </p>

                    imgtweets was active from May 2022 until June 2023. During
                    those 13 months...

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I started making imgtweets after I got frustrated trying to
                    find posts from user's timelines. Around the same time,
                    Twitter was also really starting to lockout people who
                    didn't have an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of really cool creators on Twitter who share
                    their work. However, it's often difficult to find what
                    you're looking for. I wanted a way to browse Twitter without
                    having to use Twitter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It makes me happy to see how many people came to use the
                    site. I didn't post about it or try spreading the word, so
                    the fact that over 100k people were able to find it on their
                    own is really cool. It's fulfilling to know that I wasn't
                    the only person who was looking for something like this.
